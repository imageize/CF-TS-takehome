# Data Map - Overview

This is the implementation plan for the little data map projecr: 


 - an interactive data map that visualizes systems, data categories, and how they relate to each other.

  - displays systems in a grid, grouped by system type or data use.
  
  - users can filter by data use and data categories, expand descriptions, and see dependency relationships between systems.

  - everything is broken out into separate docs so we can track what's done and what's next.

  - pay close attention to naming conventions for every task **[conventions.md](conventions.md)**



The full plan is split into separate docs so we can track progress and add new instructions easily.

## Structure

- **[overview.md](overview.md)** – What we're building, high-level context
- **[conventions.md](conventions.md)** - Naming conventions and code standards.
- **[data/types-and-utils.md](data/types-and-utils.md)** – Types and utility functions
- **[pages/data-map-page.md](pages/data-map-page.md)** – Main page layout and route
- **[components/system-card.md](components/system-card.md)** – SystemCard component
- **[components/filters.md](components/filters.md)** – Filter controls and layout toggle
- **[enhancements/dependencies.md](enhancements/dependencies.md)** – Dependency visualization
- **[enhancements/animations.md](enhancements/animations.md)** – Animations and polish
- **[integration.md](integration.md)** – Header, README, final touches

Use these files to see what's done and what to do next.
